Welcome to the How To Use section of the application. Below, you will find instructions on how to use various features:

1. Drawing:

To draw, simply hold down left click, drag and start drawing !

2. Selecting Colors:

To select colors, you can either click on one of the nine colors buttons or use the RGB Selector, which you can learn more about below.

3. Saving and Loading:

In order to save / load, the program creates a CSV files that contain each pixel data, for now, you cannot retrieve that file, but I might make it possible in later version.

4. RGB Selector:

To use the RGB Selector you must first press the corresponding button, then you can enter the color you wish to use.

5. TEXT Mode

The text mode is a proof-of-concept, so it lacks some feature, for instance, you can only write 1 text at a time, and only 1 will be saved.
